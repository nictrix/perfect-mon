# perfect-mon

The best kind of monitoring is one that fixes the problem!
This script will keep your server from being overwelmed!
It won't wake you up in the middle of the night, it won't
provide any metrics and it will mask any repeat problems!

Recommended for stateless, autoscaled, config managed servers.

Usage: Run in a cron or daemonze a process for it (./perfect-mon.sh)
